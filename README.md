# Runway + Arduino

A collection of examples and tutorials on how to use [Runway](https://runwayapp.ai/) with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).

## Examples


## Library

Ideally this will become a standalone library that manages the serial connection between Arduino devices and Runway.

## Contributing

This is still a work in progress. Contributions are welcomed!
